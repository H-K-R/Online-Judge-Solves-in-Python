# As a beginner to the programming, Mishki came to Hackerearth platform, to become a better programmer. She solved some 
# problems and felt very confident. Later being a fan of Hackerearth, she gave a problem to her friends to solve. They will
# be given a string containing only lower case characters (a-z), and they need to find that by using the characters of the
# given string, how many times they can print "hackerearth"(without quotes). As they are new to programming world, please
# help them.
#
# Input:
# The first line will consists of one integer N denoting the length of string.
# Next line will contain the string Str containing only lower case characters.
#
# Output:
# Print one integer, denoting the number of times her friends can print "hackerearth" (without quotes).
#
# Constraints:
# 1 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 106
# Each character of string Str will be in range [a,z]
