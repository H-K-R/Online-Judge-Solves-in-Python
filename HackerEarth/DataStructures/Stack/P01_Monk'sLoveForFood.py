# Our monk loves food. Hence,he took up position of a manager at Sagar,a restaurant that serves people with delicious
# food packages. It is a very famous place and people are always queuing up to have one of those packages. Each package
# has a cost associated with it. The packages are kept as a pile. The job of a manager is very difficult. He needs to
# handle two types of queries:
#
# 1) Customer Query:
# When a customer demands a package, the food package on the top of the pile is given and the customer is charged
# according to the cost of the package. This reduces the height of the pile by 1.
# In case the pile is empty, the customer goes away empty-handed.
#
# 2) Chef Query:
# The chef prepares a food package and adds it on top of the pile. And reports the cost of the package to the Manager.
# Help him manage the process.
#
# Input:
# First line contains an integer Q, the number of queries. Q lines follow.
# A Type-1 ( Customer) Query, is indicated by a single integer 1 in the line.
# A Type-2 ( Chef) Query, is indicated by two space separated integers 2 and C (cost of the package prepared) .
#
# Output:
# For each Type-1 Query, output the price that customer has to pay i.e. cost of the package given to the customer in a
# new line. If the pile is empty, print "No Food" (without the quotes).
#
# Constraints:
# 1 ≤ Q ≤ 105
# 1 ≤ C ≤ 107
